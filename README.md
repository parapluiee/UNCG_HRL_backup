A backup of scripts used by UNCG HRL (to this day to my knowledge).

At the Housing and Residence Life Department of UNCG (where I began as a front desk assistant and was promoted to Assistant to the Director of Technology), there were various off-site databases and API's which were licensed by the university, but no one technology conjoining them. Their work around was to use Google Sheets for all official data organization, and were hesitant to switch to a more modern management system because of 1) cost, and 2) the senior (and aged) staff would be unable to learn these technologies efficiently.

This gave rise to multiple issues, mainly the manual, and in some cases hourly. importing of data from our offsite database, and the lack of good statistics (as no one was a proficient google sheets user). As a side project, I was given access to database keys and developped an automatic data retrieval system, and whenever a statistical question was asked by upper management, I would create a script to automatically calculate these figures, which were then passed to a google analytics workflow.
